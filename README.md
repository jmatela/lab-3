## Lab 3

### App Description
In this lab we will make our app finally a fully functional app that you can actually use to study and ship on the App Store (but don't ship it yet, wait for Lab 4 where we will add some magic âœ¨). We're going to allow users to create as many flashcards as they want, browse through them and persist them even if they close the app. While building this you will learn how to store data and how to write more complex logic. This lab incorporates the following required and optional steps:
Set of flashcards
Browsing through flashcards
Saving to disk
Reading from disk
